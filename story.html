    <h1>Our Story</h1>
    <h3>Now, I love you more than myself, my love... I’m truly obsessed with you.</h3>
    <p> I never imagined that a guy like me—who used to think relationships were nonsense and just a waste of time—would one day fall so deeply in love.
I don’t know what it was, how it happened, or why… but whatever it was, it was beautiful, and it changed everything.
Right now, I’m at a point where words feel too small to describe what I feel for you.
I never believed that real love could be this pure… this magical</p>
<h3>Let’s rewind to December 2024.</h3>
<p>An astrologer once told me, “Beta, 2025 is going to be a very special year for you. You’ll experience every emotion deeply, and your career will start to take shape.”
I smiled when I heard that, but then he said something that I couldn't believe—
“At the beginning of 2025, someone will come into your life. Someone who will stay forever. Someone who will be your true love.”

I laughed.
Love? Me?
I never thought any girl would enter my life… and even if she did, I wouldn’t let her stay. That’s what I believed.</p>
<h3>Then came February 2025.</h3>
<p>I started talking to a girl from my class. We were technically classmates, but honestly, we were strangers.
I don’t know what destiny had planned… but slowly, we started talking.
That talking became a friendship. And that friendship… became something more.</p>
<p>I started liking her.
Of course, liking someone isn’t that big of a deal…
But day by day, our conversations grew deeper.
We shared thoughts, emotions, secrets — it felt like we were becoming one soul.
Even during our 12th board exams, we never stopped talking.
We used to steal time just to be in touch — sometimes 4 to 5 hours a day, sometimes even through the night.
When she was busy studying, I’d find myself missing her badly… but I kept telling myself:
She’s just a friend. Once school ends, so will this connection.</p>
<h3>But life had other plans. I still remember the night before Navratri began.</h3>
<h4>It was around 2 AM.</h4>
<p>We were having a deep, heartfelt conversation — the kind that you never forget.
Maybe I was already falling in love with her by then… maybe more than I realized.

We started talking about marriage, playfully at first.
And suddenly she said something that stopped my heart:
“I think I’d be happy if I married someone like you.”</p>
<p>I was stunned. Completely silent.
But I couldn’t hold it in anymore, so I told her the truth:
“I like you… a lot.”

She was shocked too.
Then she confessed something that gave me goosebumps —
She had liked me since Class 10.
But we were strangers back then. No conversations. No real interaction.
And yet… destiny kept us close enough to one day become everything to each other.</p>
<h3>That's how our love story began.</h3>
<p>We also made some unforgettable school memories together…
